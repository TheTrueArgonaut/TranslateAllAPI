            The Service may contain content appropriate for children under the
            age of 13. As a parent, you should know that through the Service
            children under the age of 13 may participate in activities that
            involve the collection or use of personal information. We use
            reasonable efforts to ensure that before we collect any personal
            information from a child, the child's parent receives notice of and
            consents to our personal information practices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We also may limit how We collect, use, and store some of the
            information of Users between 13 and 18 years old. In some cases,
            this means We will be unable to provide certain functionality of the
            Service to these Users. If We need to rely on consent as a legal
            basis for processing Your information and Your country requires
            consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before
            We collect and use that information.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We may ask a User to verify its date of birth before collecting any
            personal information from them. If the User is under the age of 13,
            the Service will be either blocked or redirected to a parental
            consent process.
